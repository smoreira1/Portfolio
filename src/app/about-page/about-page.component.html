      Welcome to my portfolio. I'm Stephen. A passionate developer with a focus and high excitment around the full web application
      stack. It's a fanstisc time to be a developer but also certainly a challenging one. With access to a smart phone becoming
      more pervalent than some of our basic needs, we have obtained an enourmous amount of reach power with a diverse amount
      of form factors. Not only do we have our big three: HTML, CSS, JavaScript; we have mutiple front-end frameworks and
      libraries to support our ennormous web applications. Angular, React, Bootstrap, Polymer to name a few. The demand for
      engineers to be familar with the entire stack is becoming a much more common. This porfolio application is not only
      for potential scouts; but for myself as well. To keep track of what I have learned, what I'm currently learning, and
      what other fields I would potentially want to work on in the future.
