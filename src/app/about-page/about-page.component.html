        Welcome to my portfolio. I'm Stephen. A passionate developer with a focus and high excitment around the full web application
        stack. It's a fanstisc time to be a developer but also certainly a challenging one. With access to a smart phone
        becoming more pervalent than some of our basic needs, we have obtained an enourmous amount of reach power with a
        diverse amount of form factors. Not only do we have our big three: HTML, CSS, JavaScript; we have mutiple front-end
        frameworks and libraries to support our ennormous web applications. Angular, React, Bootstrap, Polymer to name a
        few. The demand for engineers to be familar with the entire stack is becoming a much more common. This porfolio application
        is not only for potential scouts; but for myself as well. To keep track of what I have learned, what I'm currently
        learning, and what other fields I would potentially want to work on in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        My hobbies do include being at starbucks on the weekends learning new technolgoies as well as refining ones I'm already
        familiar with; my long term goal would be to make an application that I could make a bussiness around it. Some other hobbies include
        general reading, going to the movies, playing Overwatch & visiting the Orlando theme-parks Disney and Universal.

        Our field is massive. The more you learn the more you realize there's so much more you don't know. Time seems to particularly
        seems out of sync with the rest of the world when it comes to our field. Progressive web applications, Virtual Reality,
        A.I, Augmented reality and the list go on and on. The biggest thing I worry about is I won't have the time in my
        life time to explore the other possibilities. Currently I have limited myself to the top three interests when it
        comes to learning and developing. Progressive Web Applications, Virtual Reality & Artificial intelligence. On my next pages
        are a very surface level of what I have been exposed to so far; what I feel comfortable in; as well as what I am aware
        of and in the process of learning.
